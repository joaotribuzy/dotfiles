This repo contains all the basic stuff that I need on a new Mac. The purpose of the repo is to install all the tools that I need by running a single script. This is inspired by [Holman’s article](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) and [Daniel Passos’s dotfiles](https://github.com/danielpassos/dotfiles), to whom I am very thankful for introducing me to this concept.

## Prerequisites

2. Make sure you have logged in to the *App Store* to be able to use [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas).

## Setup
`sh setup`
1. Install all the apps and tools listed in the [Brewfile](https://github.com/joaotribuzy/dotfiles/blob/main/homebrew/Brewfile).

3. Copy the [Oh-My-Zsh config file](https://github.com/joaotribuzy/dotfiles/blob/main/zsh/.zshrc) to the system `.zshrc`.
